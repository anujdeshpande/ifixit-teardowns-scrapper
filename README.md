Teardown Data from iFixit
======

Teardowns are immensely helpful when building things. One of the many things that it helps out in is understanding the ICs that other manufacturers are using.

iFixit is one of the coolest places where there are regular teardowns. A lot of sites like engadget, etc cover stuff that comes up on iFixit.

As such, this data is not really structured. For example, if I am looking for to add an battery charger IC to my next project, I won't be able to check all the possible options that people have used in one go on iFixit (I don't think that's the point of their website anyways). But it's a great piece of information to have if say for example 15 out of 30 gadgets are using the same IC. 


### How did I go about it
There are quite a few issues here :

1. Not all teardowns have followed the color code thing. Some just mention the IC names in simple black bullet lists. I haven't caught those cases yet.
2. Sometimes they will mention components in black bullets, even if they have colored bullets elsewhere in the same teardown.
3. Of the 609 links that I scrapped on 15th June, '15, there are quite a few repetetions (non-English versions, from different users, etc.) I haven't yet deduplicated my list (or found a clean way to do it)
